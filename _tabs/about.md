Hello there !

On the off chance that you stumble upon my blog, let me introduce myself! 

I'm C Anirudh, I work as an Associate Software Engineer in Oracle, India, in the Hospitality Global Business Unit. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, Kollam. I code, watch anime/ TV series and love reading books. This blog emerged out of a need for me to express myself and muse over myriad topics.
