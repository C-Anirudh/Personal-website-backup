## Round 1

Round 1 was an online MCQ round consisting of aptitude, verbals, reasoning, and technical questions. The round was divided into many sections with a separate time frame for each section. The total time, including all sections, was 107 minutes. 

## Round 2 (Coding Round)

Round 2 was an online coding round, in which we were given two coding questions to solve within 60 minutes: 
- [Graph m coloring problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/m-coloring-problem-backtracking-5/) (A slightly modified version of the original question)
- Print a string in zig-zag format (Similar question: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-concatenation-of-zig-zag-string-form-in-n-rows/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-concatenation-of-zig-zag-string-form-in-n-rows/))

## Round 3 (Interview Round)

The interviews were held over Zoom and consisted of the following rounds: 
- Two Technical Interviews (about 1 hour each)
- One HR Interview (about 30 mins)

### Some of the Interview questions

Both the technical interviewers took 2 minutes to read my resume and then asked questions based on it.

- Introduce yourself (2 times in both tech rounds)
- Rate yourself in the following:
    - C++ 
    - Data Structures 
    - SQL
- OOPs/Java questions
    - What is OOPs?
    - What are the main concepts in OOPs? (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism with real world examples)
    - What is an example of runtime polymorphism? (function overriding)
    - What is function overriding? What is function overloading? Difference between the two.
    - He asked me syntax to inherit class in C++, the extends keyword is in Java.
    - What is the difference between C++ and Java?
    - What is JDK, JRE, JVM ?
    - What is constructor?
    - What is destructor?
    - Why is return type of main void in Java? Return type of main in C++?
    - He asked me output of following:
```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(10 + 20 + "TestCode");
        System.out.println("TestCode" + 10 + 20);
        System.out.println(10 * 20 + "TestCode");
        System.out.println("TestCode" + 20*10);
    }
}
```
 
- DBMS questions
    - Query to find the maximum salary from employee table? (ans: `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee`)
    - What is primary key? What is foreign key?
    - What is SQL? 
    - Difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE command?
    - What is transaction? I was also asked about the life cycle of a transaction (partially committed, committed, ROLLBACK). 
- Other technical questions
    - I was asked to code the following question in Round 1: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-two-numbers-without-using-arithmetic-operators/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-two-numbers-without-using-arithmetic-operators/)
    - I was asked to explain bubble sort in both tech rounds (asked to write pseudo code in second tech round)
    - I was asked to explain and write pseudo code for binary search.
    - He gave me a binary tree structure and asked all three traversal: postorder, preorder & inorder. He asked if given preorder traversal, can I tell postorder traversal?
    - What is virtual table?
    - What is MVC architecture?
- Resume based questions
   - I was asked to explain each of my projects.
   - Some questions mentioned above were also from resume.
- Other questions
    - In round 2 I was asked this puzzle question: [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1143132/is-there-a-size-of-rectangle-that-retains-its-ratio-when-its-folded-in-half](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1143132/is-there-a-size-of-rectangle-that-retains-its-ratio-when-its-folded-in-half)  
    - In round 2 I was asked this aptitude question: Distance between A and B is 100 kms. One person starts from city A at 50 kmph and another starts from B at 40 kmph. At what point will they meet?
